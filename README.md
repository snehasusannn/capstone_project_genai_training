Retail AI Ticket Analyzer
# Retail AI Ticket Analyzer

## Project Overview

Retail AI Ticket Analyzer is a multi-agent AI system designed to automate retail incident ticket processing using Generative AI, RAG, and workflow orchestration.

The system can:

* classify retail incident tickets
* detect issue severity
* retrieve relevant SOP documents using RAG
* generate AI-powered resolution suggestions
* escalate high-risk tickets for human approval
* log and monitor workflow decisions

The project demonstrates:

* Multi-Agent AI Architecture
* Sequential Workflow
* Router-Based Workflow
* Parallel Batch Processing
* Human-in-the-Loop Approval
* RAG-based Knowledge Retrieval
* Error Handling and Retries

# Architecture Overview

## Core Components

### 1. Input Layer

Receives tickets through:

* CSV batch uploads
* Live ticket forms

---

### 2. Orchestrator

Central workflow controller responsible for:

* calling agents sequentially
* maintaining ticket context
* handling retries
* logging decisions
* managing routing logic

Main function:

```python
run_pipeline(ticket)
```

---

### 3. Classification Agent

Uses Gemini LLM to:

* understand issue descriptions
* classify retail incidents
* generate confidence scores

Outputs:

* category
* confidence_score

---

### 4. Severity Detection Agent

Determines:

* severity level
* escalation requirements

Implements router logic for:

* critical incidents
* fraud alerts
* low-confidence predictions

Outputs:

* severity
* severity_reason
* escalate

---

### 5. RAG Pipeline

Knowledge retrieval system using:

* SOP PDF documents
* document chunking
* Gemini embeddings
* vector database
* semantic search

Retrieves top relevant SOP chunks for resolution generation.

---

### 6. Resolution Suggestion Agent

Uses:

* ticket context
* retrieved SOPs
* Gemini LLM

to generate suggested resolutions.

Outputs:

* suggested_resolution
* resolution_source

---

### 7. Human Approval Agent

Handles:

* approval routing
* human review
* final ticket decisions

Supports:

* approve
* reject
* modify workflows

Outputs:

* human_approved
* approver_notes
* final_status

---

# Workflow Types

## Sequential Workflow

```text
Classification
→ Severity Detection
→ RAG Retrieval
→ Resolution Generation
→ Human Approval
```

---

## Router-Based Workflow

Dynamic escalation based on:

* severity
* confidence score
* fraud detection

Example:

```python
if severity == "critical":
    escalate = True
```

---

## Parallel Workflow

Supports concurrent batch ticket processing using:

* threading
* asyncio

Multiple tickets can be processed simultaneously.

---

# Shared Ticket Object

All agents communicate using a standardized shared ticket object.

Key fields:

* ticket_id
* issue_description
* category
* severity
* retrieved_docs
* suggested_resolution
* final_status
* error_log

This ensures consistent data flow across modules.

---

# Technologies Used

* Python
* Gemini LLM
* Gemini Embeddings
* RAG Pipeline
* Vector Database
* Streamlit
* Threading / Asyncio

---

# Error Handling Features

* Retry handling
* Safe fallback defaults
* Human escalation
* Structured logging
* Failure tracking

The pipeline never crashes and always returns a valid ticket object.
